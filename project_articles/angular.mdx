Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Why not indeed!

You don't know how to do any of those. Can I use the gun? I love this planet! __I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.__ *But I know you in the future.* I cleaned your poop.

Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

2. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.
3. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!
