# It's toe-tappingly tragic!

Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. That's not soon enough! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? __Soothe us with sweet lies.__ *Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes!* We have bigger problems.

## Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

1. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!
2. Oh yeah, good luck with that.
3. Really?!

### My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Kids have names? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

* Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
* Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!
* And I'm his friend Jesus.

Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Who am I making this out to? I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?

Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? I don't want to be rescued. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.

Bender, we're trying our best. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Ooh, name it after me! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! A true inspiration for the children. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! No, I'm Santa Claus!

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Throw her in the brig. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Also Zoidberg. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

Fatal. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? I can explain. It's very valuable. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
