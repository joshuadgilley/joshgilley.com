# I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.

Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. __Clamps, burn down the crew.__ *Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.* But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

## Bender?! You stole the atom.

With gusto. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Shinier than yours, meatbag. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

1. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?
2. Leela's gonna kill me.
3. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

### I don't want to be rescued.

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

* That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
* You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.
* You can see how I lived before I met you.

Your best is an idiot! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Meh. You lived before you met me?! I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Ow, my spirit!

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Why did you bring us here? We're also Santa Claus! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.

Also Zoidberg. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? What are their names? No, she'll probably make me do it. She also liked to shut up!

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. You lived before you met me?! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. You lived before you met me?! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Negative, bossy meat creature!

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Fatal. Ask her how her day was. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
