# React.js - What are the pros and cons?

React 18 (also known as React.js) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

## Some pros of using React include:

-   A large and active community, which means there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting
-   A component-based architecture, which can make it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications
-   Virtual DOM, which improves the performance of updates by only re-rendering the components that have actually changed
-   React Native, a framework that allows developers to use React to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android

## Some cons of using React include:
-   A relatively steep learning curve, as it requires a solid understanding of JavaScript and web development concepts
-   The need for additional libraries or frameworks to handle certain functionality, such as routing and state management.
-   The frequent updates to the React framework which can make it hard to maintain the codebase.

It's worth noting that React 18 is not a version of React, React 18 is a codename for React version 17, the current version of React is React 17.0.0
