# I don't want to be rescued.

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Why not indeed!

You don't know how to do any of those. Can I use the gun? I love this planet! __I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.__ *But I know you in the future.* I cleaned your poop.

## Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!

Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

1. Anyone who laughs is a communist!
2. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.
3. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

### Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

Soothe us with sweet lies. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

* You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?
* Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.
* With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. What are their names? I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

You're going to do his laundry? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. We're also Santa Claus! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! You can see how I lived before I met you.

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

Is that a cooking show? A true inspiration for the children. No. We're on the top. Who are those horrible orange men? With gusto.

When will that be? I never loved you. Really?! Negative, bossy meat creature! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Yeah, lots of people did. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

Why not indeed! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

Belligerent and numerous. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. You can see how I lived before I met you. Say what?

Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Hey, whatcha watching? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!
