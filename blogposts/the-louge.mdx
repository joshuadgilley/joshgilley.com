# Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.

Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.

I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Professor, make a woman out of me. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Oh, but you can. __But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil.__ * And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil.* And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

## Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

1. Who are those horrible orange men?
2. So, how 'bout them Knicks?
3. It's toe-tappingly tragic!

### I never loved you.

You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Guess again. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Hello Morbo, how's the family? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

* Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
* Then we'll go with that data file!
* You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! And I'm his friend Jesus. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!

Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Pansy. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. You know, I was God once. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

No! The cat shelter's on to me. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!

No, I'm Santa Claus! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Negative, bossy meat creature! I had more, but you go ahead. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Ow, my spirit! You can see how I lived before I met you. No, she'll probably make me do it. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Pansy. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

Meh. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? She also liked to shut up! Moving along… Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.
